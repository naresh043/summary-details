      <summary>CHE GUEVERA</summary>
      <h3>About</h3> 
      <p>Ernesto <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara">"Che"</a> Guevara was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, guerrilla leader, diplomat, and military theorist. He was a major figure in the Cuban Revolution and his stylized visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol of rebellion and global insignia in popular culture.

        Born on June 14, 1928, in Rosario, Argentina, Che traveled extensively through South America in his youth, a journey that awakened him to the inequality and exploitation prevalent across the continent. This experience was pivotal in shaping his revolutionary ideologies.
        
        After meeting Fidel Castro and his brother Raúl in Mexico, Che joined their 26th of July Movement and played a key role in the guerrilla war against Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. Che's efforts were instrumental in the eventual overthrow of Batista in 1959, after which he held several key positions in the new government.
        
        Che left Cuba in the mid-1960s to foster revolution internationally, first in Congo-Kinshasa and later in Bolivia, where he was captured by CIA-assisted Bolivian forces and executed on October 9, 1967.
        
        Che Guevara remains a controversial and complex figure, revered by some as a hero who fought for the oppressed, and criticized by others as a ruthless executioner. His written works, including "The Motorcycle Diaries," which details his early travels, and "Guerrilla Warfare," provide insight into his thoughts and methods.
